# Climate Analysis
In this project I used SQLite file: hawaii.sqlite and performed data exploration and analysis using Python 3 and Pandas library. I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries within Flask app (app.py) to connect to DB and reflect tables into classes. Data being displayed as jsonify response to specific API call. Plots been created with Matplotlib. Additional comments provided in climate_analysis.ipynb as code progresses.
