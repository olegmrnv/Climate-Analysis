# Climate Analysis
In this project I used SQLite file: hawaii.sqlite and performed data exploration and analysis using Python 3 and Pandas library. I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries to connect to DB and reflect tables into classes. Plots been created with Matplotlib. Additional comments provided in climate_analysis.ipynb as code progresses.
